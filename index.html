        While croissants are often associated with France, it is believed that
        their origins can be traced back to Austria. Legend has it that the
        croissant was invented in Vienna in 1683, when the city was under siege
        by the Ottoman Turks. As the story goes, Viennese bakers who were
        working in the early morning hours heard the sound of the Turks
        tunneling beneath the city and sounded the alarm. The bakers then
        created a crescent-shaped pastry in the shape of the Ottoman flag to
        commemorate the victory over the Turks. However, over time, the
        croissant became associated with France and is now considered a staple
        of French cuisine.
